      Commercial content moderators are employed by third-party companies as <span>independent contractors</span> rather than IT companies directly. This arrangement results in severe underpayment, with many moderators earning roughly <span>$8 per hour</span>, and geographic dispersion around the world. As a result, these workers are forced to reconcile the discrepancies between their own cultural, linguistic, contextual, and political understanding of the content they are reviewing and the primarily <span>Western lens</span> that represents the companies they are moderating for.
